// Line Sweep Algorithm or Plane Sweep Algorithm or Sweep Line Algorithm or Events

// line sweep algorithm is used to solve probmes that involve intervals or events that have a start and end time such as meeting scheduling, interval scheduling, train arrival and departure, customer arrival and departure at resturant, etc.
// it is used to find intersections, union, difference, etc. of intervals (line segments) or events
// the algorithm works by sorting the events by their start time and then iterating through the events
// at each event, we can update the state of the algorithm and then check if the state satisfies the problem constraints
// the algorithm is O(nlogn) where n is the number of events
//  # 2^n subset generation of a set nums
// think of the events as a line that sweeps through the plane and intersects with the intervals
// the line is the current time and the intervals are the events
// increase the active by 1 when interval start and decrease the active by 1 when intervals end
