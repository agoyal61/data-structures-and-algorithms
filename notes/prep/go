1. graph
2. DP
3. Tree
4. string
5. Trie


Emphasized the following topics for DSA round:
* 		Graph: BFS, DFS, Topological sort, Shortest Path
* 		Tree: Binary tree, Binary search Tree, N child tree
* 		Trie: Prefix search, Word search with counts
* 		Disjoint set union
* 		Heap: Median in a stream, Sliding window maximum, Top k elements
* 		Binary Search: Lower bound, Upper bound, Questions where binary search is not the obvious choice
* 		Sliding window and 2 pointers based questions
* 		Dynamic programming
* 		Strings: KMP, String sorting
* 		Adhoc questions on the application of Array, Stack, Queue, HashMap, TreeMap


Google mostly prefer Graphs, Trees and String questions.
HashMap + LRU technique.
DP, binary search and Graph
Topological Sort
Graph, DP, Tree, Trie, String

Got string matching problem. Tried solving using LPS (KMP)
Rabin karp - rolling hash is much easier to implement during interviews
