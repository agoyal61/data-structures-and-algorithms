class and objects

MyStruct myObj = MyStruct(); // This line declares an object myObj of type MyStruct and initializes it by explicitly calling the default constructor

It's equivalent to the following declarations:
MyStruct myObj; // default constructor is called implicitly if it exists

MyStruct* myObj = new MyStruct(); // myObj is now a pointer to a new MyStruct object

// In C++, new is used for dynamic allocation of objects, and it returns a pointer to the allocated memory. So if you use new, you should handle the object through a pointer, not a regular object of the class/struct type.
// In this case, myObj is a pointer to a MyStruct object that has been dynamically allocated on the heap. You would access members of the MyStruct object using the -> operator instead of the . operator.
