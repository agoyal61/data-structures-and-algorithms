/*
is correct in C and also in C++ for defining a structure named Node that represents a node in a binary tree. It explicitly uses the struct keyword before
 Node when declaring pointers to the left and right child nodes. This is necessary in C to refer to a type defined by a struct, but it is also valid syntax
  in C++:
*/
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *left, *right;
};

int countNodes(struct Node* s) {

}

/*
However, in C++, the struct keyword is optional when referring to a type defined by a struct.
The following code is equivalent to the previous example:
he second snippet is more typical of C++ code. In C++, once a struct type is defined, you can refer to it by its name without needing to prefix it with the
struct keyword when declaring variables or types. This makes the code a bit cleaner and more similar to class usage in C++. This syntax is not valid in standard C, as C requires the struct keyword to reference struct types:
*/

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left, *right;
};

int countNodes(Node* s) {
    
}

// This snippet correctly uses this-> to refer to member variables. This is a valid and common practice, especially for clarity when parameter names match member variable names.
// Structure of a node of linked list
struct Node {
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* arbit;
   
    // Constructor
    Node(int x)
    {
        this->val = x;
        this->next = NULL;
        this->arbit = NULL;
    }
};

// names of the constructor's parameters do not conflict with the names of the member variables, there's no ambiguity, and thus direct assignment without this-> is perfectly clear and correct.
// Structure of a node of linked list
struct Node {
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* arbit;
   
    // Constructor
    Node(int x)
    {
       val = x;
       next = NULL;
        >arbit = NULL;
    }
